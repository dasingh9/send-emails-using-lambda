### Flow
- This Lambda is triggered when a customers.txt file is uploaded to S3 bucket
- The Lambda reads the customer name and email address from customers.txt from s3 bucket using `@aws-sdk/client-s3` package
- The Lambda converts the records to a JSON array of customers
- The Lambda calls SendGrid API using `@sendgrid/mail` npm package to send Pizza deals to customers' emails.
- The Lambda saves record to MongoDB using MongoClient from `mongodb` package.
